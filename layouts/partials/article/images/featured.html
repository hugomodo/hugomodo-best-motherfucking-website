  TODO:
  - I think _internal/twitter_cards checks for an image resource with *featured*.
    - We should do the same. Should it be prioritised over first image?
  - Consider also a headerImage or featuredImage variable in frontmatter.
  - And headerImageAlt or featuredImageAlt for alt tag.
    - maybe also ..Title, maybe also ..Caption (if figure)

  NOTE:
    Twitter Cards uses first *featured*, then checks for either of *cover* or *thumbnail*
